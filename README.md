## DESCRIPTION

Project Byield testnet, also known as GoNative Testnet, is a platform that allows users to generate yield from their Bitcoin holdings without needing to bridge or wrap Bitcoin, or rely on centralized custodians. Built on the Sui network, which offers high-speed transactions and low costs, this script functions to automatically exchange $SUI for $NBTC on the Testnet.
